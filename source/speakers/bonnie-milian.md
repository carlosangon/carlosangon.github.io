In this talk we’ll learn how to give the first steps into learning AI, through sharing my own experience we’ll review the excitement, suspense, frustration and hype around it. We’ll discuss some basic concepts that serve as starting point, how any of us, either beginner or seasoned developer, can get into AI and why it’s important to do at least some toe dipping into DL.
