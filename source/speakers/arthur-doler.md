talk: The Developer’s Guide to Learning Effectively
bio: Arthur (or Art) has been a software engineer for 13 years and has worked on things as exciting as analysis software for casinos & as boring as banking websites. He's an advocate for talking openly about mental health and psychology in the tech world, and he spends a lot of time thinking about how and why we program, & about the tools, structures, cultures, and mental processes that help and hinder us from our goal of writing amazing things. His hair is brown and his thorax is a shiny blue color.

The ability to learn things is an essential part of the developer’s toolkit, which is only getting more important - there will probably be at least one new Javascript framework released just in the time it takes you to read this abstract.

The thing is, we’re never really taught HOW to learn things - we’re expected to just figure it out ourselves. It is my opinion that this is Really Terrible. If you share that opinion, do something about it by coming to this talk! We’ll cover the types of learning and how to find which ones work for you. Do you wonder how learning a new framework is different than learning best practices for that framework? We’ll discuss that, too! We’ll also talk about the neuroscience of learning, how your brain connects cause and effect, the tricks your memory plays on you, and more. By the end, you’ll hopefully have the tools you need to learn anything efficiently and effectively.
