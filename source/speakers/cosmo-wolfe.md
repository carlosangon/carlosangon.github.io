This talk covers a series of approaches we used to migrate a monolith backend that served several hundred pages (slowly) to be a React/Redux/Typescript single page app—without sacrificing user or developer experience. This process allowed engineers to actively develop on the codebase (despite the ongoing migration) and increased feature development velocity. Most importantly, it did all this while maintaining the user experience.
