In this talk, we will discuss a few small steps any developer can take to make their code a little more 'reasonable'. While everyone has a different definition of what is reasonable, we will focus on the Functional Programming concepts like immutability and pure-functions that can make your code easier to reason about, and make it more trustworthy. We will look at how a functional style can simplify your code and tests.
